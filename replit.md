# Monsoon Insurance Platform - India

## Overview

A comprehensive single-page web application for browsing and purchasing monsoon insurance policies in India. Built with authentic Indian parametric insurance data and implementing proven models from successful programs like Nagaland's DRTPS and SEWA women workers initiatives.

## System Architecture

**Current Implementation**: Production-ready web application with proper server
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML5 with Alpine.js for interactivity
- Backend: Node.js Express server with health check endpoints
- Styling: Tailwind CSS via CDN
- Data: Authentic Indian weather risk data embedded in application
- Deployment: Node.js server with proper health checks for cloud deployment

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Parametric insurance model with automatic payouts based on rainfall thresholds
- Embedded authentic data from 16 major Indian states
- Express.js server with compression, CORS, and health check endpoints
- Mobile-responsive design with professional UI
- Proper deployment configuration for cloud platforms

## Key Components

**Implemented Features**:
- Insurance policy browsing with 5 authentic policy types (₹50K to ₹20L coverage)
- Premium calculator with state-based risk assessment
- Weather risk visualization for 16 Indian states
- Policy application form with validation
- Parametric insurance education and information

**Data Sources**:
